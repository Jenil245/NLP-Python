# Sentiment Classification Amazon-review

<b> Final_Amazon_VideoGames_Reviews_NLP file contains all data cleaning and data preprocessing </b>

<ul><li>
In this project I have applied NLP techniques to classify sentiment of review. I went through all process of building a NLP engine which includes <b>data cleaning, data mining, data wrangling and building a model</b>. I have used three approaches to solve this problem.</li><br><li>
First I used all algorithms individually and explored their performance. Logistic Regression beat almost all algorithms by far distance.</li><br><li>
Then I created <b>voted classifier</b> which consists of <b>seven</b> different classifiers. It predicts review sentiments with confidence level but I didn't get results which I wanted.</li><br><li>
So then I created Deep Learning model which used Word Embedding and LSTM layers. Here I got <b>80%</b> accuracy but it was not that significantly different then previous models but you can increase accuracy of this model by adding more layers, neurons and data. Because of RAM requirements I was not able to build models on whole dataset. </li><br>

<li>Conclusion:
For getting more accuracy you have to use deep learning models because in ML models COW and TFIDF does not present much values, it basically predictes label on count of words that are present in review. But they are still a good choice for low resources.<br>
